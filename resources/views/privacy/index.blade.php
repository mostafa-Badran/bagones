                    secure servers in order to provide the best possible user experience for the Service and/or
                    Platform, current or upcoming. For example â€“ for fast website or mobile application build up.</p>

                    it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
                </p>
                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
                    your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
                    those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>9. Technical and organizational measures and processing security</p>
                <p>All the information we receive about you are stored on secure servers and we have basic measures that
                    are suitable to protect your personal data. Bagdones continually evaluates the security of its
                    network and adequacy of its internal information security program which is designed to (a) help
                    secure your data against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably
                    foreseeable risks to the security of the Bagdones network, and (c) minimize security risks,
                    including through risk assessment and regular testing. In addition, we ensure that all payment data
                    are encrypted using SSL technology.</p>
                <p>Please note, despite the measures we have implemented to protect your data, the transfer of data
                    through the Internet or other open networks is never completely secure and there is a risk that your
                    personal data may be accessed by unauthorized third parties.</p>
